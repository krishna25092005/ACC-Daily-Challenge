# Day 1: Reverse The Number


## Problem Statement

Given an integer `N`, the task is to reverse it.

### Input

- The first line contains an integer `T`, the total number of test cases.
- The next `T` lines each contain an integer `N`.

### Output

- For each test case, display the reverse of the given number `N` on a new line.


 ### Constraints 
 
 - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000

## Approach

To solve this problem, the following approach is used:

1. **Calculate the GCD:** The GCD of two numbers can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, which is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

2. **Calculate the LCM:** The LCM can be derived from the GCD using the formula:
   \[ \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|

3. **Output the Results:** For each test case, output the calculated GCD and LCM in the same line.

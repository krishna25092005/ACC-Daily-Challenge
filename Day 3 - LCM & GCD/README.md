# Day 3: GCD and LCM

## Problem Statement

You are given two integers A and B. The task is to compute and output the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of these two numbers.

### Input Format

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input with two integers A and B.

### Output Format

- For each test case, output the GCD and LCM on one line.

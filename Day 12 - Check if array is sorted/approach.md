## Approach

1. The arraySortedOrNot() method accepts a vector<int>& arr as an argument.
2. The function iterates through the vector and checks if any element is greater than the next one.
3. If such a pair is found, the function returns false, indicating the array is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns true, meaning the array is sorted.

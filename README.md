<p align="center">Welcome to the <strong>ACC-Daily-Challenge</strong> repository! 🚀</p>

This repository is dedicated to the daily coding challenges provided by our Coding Club's Technical Coordinator. My goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills, stay sharp, and continuously learn new concepts. Each day, a new problem will be posted, and I am encouraged to solve it, document my solution, and upload it here.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Daily Challenges**: Each day's challenge will have its own directory named after the date (e.g., `2024-09-02`). Inside each directory, you will find:
  - 📝 `problem.md`: A markdown file containing the problem statement.
  - 💻 `solution.cpp`: My C++ solution file for the problem.
  - 🧠 `README.md`: A brief explanation of my approach, logic, and any edge cases I considered.
  - 📊 `test_cases.txt`: A file containing sample input/output pairs that I used to test my solution.

## 💡 How to Contribute

1. **Solve the Daily Challenge**: 
   - 🍴 Fork this repository if you haven’t already.
   - 📥 Clone your fork to your local machine.
   - 🌱 Create a new branch for the day’s challenge.
   - 🧑‍💻 Solve the problem and save your solution in the respective directory.
   - 📄 Document your approach in the `README.md` file inside the directory.
   - 🔍 Add your test cases to the `test_cases.txt` file.
   - 💾 Commit your changes with a clear message (e.g., `Add solution for 2024-09-02 challenge`).

2. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - 🚀 Push your branch to your GitHub repository.
   - 📝 Create a pull request to merge your solution into the main branch of the original repository.
   - 🧹 Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and follows best practices.

## 🎯 Goals and Objectives

- **Enhance Problem-Solving Skills**: By solving daily challenges, I aim to improve my algorithmic thinking and coding proficiency.
- **Collaboration and Learning**: This platform encourages collaboration among members. I will review others’ solutions, suggest improvements, and learn from each other.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the Technical Coordinator for organizing these challenges and to all the participants for their enthusiasm and commitment to learning!

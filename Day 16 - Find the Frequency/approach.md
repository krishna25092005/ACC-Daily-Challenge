## Approach

1. _Function Purpose:_ 

The function findFrequency calculates the frequency of the integer X in the vector Arr by counting how many times X appears.

2. _Using STL Count Function:_ 

It utilizes the count function from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), which scans through the range Arr.begin() to Arr.end() and counts occurrences of X.

3. _Return Value:_ 

The function returns the total count of X found in the vector.

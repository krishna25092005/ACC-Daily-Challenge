# Day 15: Multiply Array

## Problem Statement

Calculate the product of all the elements in an array.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
- Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
- Output:
120

**Example 2:**
- Input:
10
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
- Output:
9765625

## Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function product() which takes the array Arr[] and its size N as inputs and returns the product of all elements.

## Constraints

- 1  ≤  N  ≤  10
- 1  ≤  A[i]  ≤  5

## Expected Time Complexity

- **O(N)**

## Expected Space Complexity

- **O(1)**

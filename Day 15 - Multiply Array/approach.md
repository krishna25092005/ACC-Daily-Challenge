## Approach

1. _Initialization:_

- The function initializes a variable product to 1, which will store the cumulative product of the array elements.

2. _Iteration:_

- A for loop iterates through each element of the array arr[] from index 0 to N-1, multiplying product by each element.

3. _Return:_

- After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of product, which is the product of all elements in the array.

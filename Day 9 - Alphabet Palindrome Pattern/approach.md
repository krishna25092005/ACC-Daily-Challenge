## Approach

1. The outer loop iterates 2 \* n times, incrementing by 2 each time (i += 2). This loop controls the number of rows in the pyramid.
2. The inner loop iterates from 0 to i (inclusive), incrementing by 1 each time (j++). This loop controls the number of characters in each row.
3. Inside the inner loop, the program prints the j-th character of the alphabet sequence using the expression (char)('A' + count). This expression converts the ASCII value of 'A' to the corresponding alphabet character based on the count value.
4. If j is less than half of i (j < i / 2), the count is incremented. This ensures that the alphabet sequence increments for the first half of each row.
5. If j is not less than half of i (j >= i / 2), the count is decremented. This ensures that the alphabet sequence decrements for the second half of each row, creating the palindrome effect.
6. After the inner loop completes, the count is reset to 0, and a newline character is printed (cout << endl;) to move to the next row.

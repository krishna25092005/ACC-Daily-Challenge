## Approach

1. **Initialize Two Vectors**:
   - One for storing positive elements.
   - One for storing negative elements.

2. **Traverse the Array**:
   - Iterate through the array and separate positive and negative elements into their respective vectors.

3. **Combine the Vectors**:
   - Copy the positive elements back to the original array.
   - Append the negative elements to the end of the array.
